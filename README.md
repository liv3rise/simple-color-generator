# 🎨 Simple Color Generator

This is my very small and simple "app" that I made for practice purposes during the first steps of learning JavaScript. It simply generates a few random HEX colors that you can copy by simply clicking on the color you like, or you can regenerate the colors by clicking on the corresponding button. Where can it be used? I don't know. It's up to you. 😁
